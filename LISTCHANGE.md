## Context Reset Prompt
When starting a new session, ask these questions to quickly understand the project:
1. "What does this project do?"
2. "What technologies does this project use?"
3. "Where is the main entry point?"
4. "Explain the folder structure"

### Direction-Based Wrong Way Detection (Enhanced)
- **Instant Detection**: Compares player's facing direction with racing line direction
- **Works at Lap 0**: Detection now works even before crossing finish line for first time
- **Vector-Based**: Uses dot product of player direction vs racing line segment direction
- **Threshold System**: Triggers when facing > 90¬∞ from correct direction (dot < -0.1)
- **Speed Check**: Only activates when moving (speed > 0.5) to avoid false positives
- **2-Second Alert Delay**: Alert shows after 2 seconds of wrong way driving to prevent false positives

### Rocket Racing Line Following (New)
- **Smart Trajectory**: Rockets now follow the racing line before targeting players
- **Two-Phase System**: 
  - Phase 1: Follow racing line to avoid walls (blue glow indicator)
  - Phase 2: Target acquisition when within 300 pixels AND line of sight (red glow indicator)
- **Enhanced Line of Sight**: 
  - Initial check: If target visible at launch, skip racing line entirely
  - Continuous monitoring: Returns to racing line if line of sight is lost
  - Prevents wall collisions on parallel track sections
- **No Distance Limit**: Rockets follow racing line for their entire 3.5-second lifetime
  - Similar to Mario Kart red shells behavior
