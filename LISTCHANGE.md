# KartRush.io Change Log

## Context Reset Prompt
When starting a new session, ask these questions to quickly understand the project:
1. "What does this project do?"
2. "What technologies does this project use?"
3. "Where is the main entry point?"
4. "Explain the folder structure"

## Project Overview (Quick Reference)
**What it does**: KartRush.io is a real-time multiplayer kart racing game with:
- Room-based multiplayer (public/private)
- Multiple maps with different themes

### Drift Visual Effects Overhaul
- Completely redesigned drift visual effects with tier-specific appearances:
  - **Blue (Mini-turbo)**: Classic blue sparks with trails
  - **Orange (Super mini-turbo)**: Flame-like particles
  - **Purple (Ultra mini-turbo)**: Intense purple sparks (removed lightning effect)
- Added dynamic drift trail that flows behind kart
- Removed circular aura effect from drifting
- Added colored smoke/trail effects matching drift charge level

### Speed Boost Visual Update
- Speed boost aura now changes color based on boost type:
  - **Green**: Regular boost pads
  - **Blue**: Level 1 drift boost
  - **Orange**: Level 2 drift boost  
  - **Purple**: Level 3 drift boost
- Removed glow aura from speed boosts (only particles and trails)
- Fixed server to send boostLevel to client for proper color detection

### Counter-Steer Jump Visual Effect
- Added visual jump effect when counter-steering during drift
- Kart scales up 40% when jumping (simulating height)
- Shadow appears and separates from kart during jump
- Shadow only visible during jump, not during normal driving
- White ring effect at peak of jump
- Takeoff and landing particle effects
- Uses counterSteerJump value from server (0-1.035)

### Level 3 Drift Boost Balance
- Increased time requirement: 2.0 seconds (was 1.5)
- Increased boost duration: 1.5 seconds (was 1.3)
- Increased max speed: 145% (was 135%)
- Increased initial impulse: +2.0 (was +1.6)
- Makes purple boost harder to achieve but more rewarding

### Poison Slick Item (New)
- **Effect**: Drops a toxic puddle that slows players to 30% speed and deals damage over time
- **Duration**: Puddle stays on track for 10 seconds
- **Damage**: 5 HP every 500ms while poisoned
- **Poison Duration**: 1 second after leaving the puddle
- **Drop Rate**: 12% (balanced with other items)
- **Visual**: Purple/green puddle using sprite from items_icons.png (bottom-mid position)
- **Audio**: slick_dropping.mp3 when used, slick_crossing.mp3 when hit
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Drops 50 pixels behind the kart
  - Owner has 1.5 second immunity to prevent self-damage
  - Aggressive slowdown with extra friction while in puddle
  - Purple screen flash and damage numbers when poisoned

### Racing Line Position System (Updated)
- **Precise Position Tracking**: Real-time position calculation based on distance along racing line
- **Map Editor Tool**: New "üèéÔ∏è Ligne de course" button to draw racing lines
- **Visual Feedback**: Click-to-close system like continuous curves, shows closing preview
- **Server Integration**: Automatic position updates using racing line when available
- **Fallback System**: Uses checkpoint-based positioning if no racing line exists
- **No Duplicate Points**: Closed loops don't store duplicate first point
- **JSON Export**: Racing line data included in map files with proper formatting
- **Wrong Way Handling**: New `wrongWayCrossing` flag system prevents exploits
  - Crossing finish line backwards sets flag (no lap change)
  - Position penalty applied through track progress calculation
  - Crossing forward again clears the penalty smoothly
  - No position flickering or sudden jumps
- **Respawn Fix**: Players with checkpoints who respawn behind start line maintain race status
- **Smooth Transitions**: Position changes based on actual track progress, not hard penalties

### Direction-Based Wrong Way Detection (Enhanced)
- **Instant Detection**: Compares player's facing direction with racing line direction
- **Works at Lap 0**: Detection now works even before crossing finish line for first time
- **Vector-Based**: Uses dot product of player direction vs racing line segment direction
- **Threshold System**: Triggers when facing > 90¬∞ from correct direction (dot < -0.1)
- **Speed Check**: Only activates when moving (speed > 0.5) to avoid false positives
- **2-Second Alert Delay**: Alert shows after 2 seconds of wrong way driving to prevent false positives
- **Replaces Progress-Based System**: More accurate than old system that waited for position loss

### Canvas-Based Wrong Way Alert (New)
- **Centered Display**: Alert appears in center of screen for maximum visibility
- **Purple Theme**: Uses game's signature purple gradient to match aesthetic
- **Subtle Pulsing**: 5% scale pulsing on box, text, and icons for attention
- **Warning Icons**: Dual warning triangles (‚ö†Ô∏è) flanking the "WRONG WAY" text
- **Semi-Transparent Overlay**: Purple background overlay with pulsing effect
- **1-Second Hide Delay**: Alert stays visible for 1 second after correcting direction
- **Replaces HTML Alert**: No more DOM-based alerts, everything rendered on canvas
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches lap notification visual style with rounded corners and glow

### Lightning Item (New)
- **Effect**: Stuns and slows all players ahead of the user
- **Stun Duration**: 1 second (players cannot move or use items)
- **Speed Reduction**: 50% speed for 7 seconds after stun
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Lightning sprite appears on all affected players
  - Blue circle aura shows speed reduction
  - Yellow screen flash for affected players
- **Drop Rate**: Currently set to 16.67% for testing (equal with other items)
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed issue where lightning sprite only appeared on one player instead of all affected players

### Code Cleanup
- **Removed Unused Variables**: Cleaned up `closestPoint` and `elapsed` variables
- **Removed Redundant Notifications**: No more yellow "Wrong way!" popup when crossing finish backwards
- **Removed Checkpoint Notifications**: No more "Il vous reste X checkpoints" messages
- **Streamlined Detection**: Single direction-based system handles all wrong way scenarios
- **Fixed TypeScript Warning**: Removed unused `isInitialPosition` parameter from `calculateTrackProgress`

### Rocket Racing Line Following (New)
- **Smart Trajectory**: Rockets now follow the racing line before targeting players
- **Two-Phase System**: 
  - Phase 1: Follow racing line to avoid walls (blue glow indicator)
  - Phase 2: Target acquisition when within 300 pixels AND line of sight (red glow indicator)
- **Enhanced Line of Sight**: 
  - Initial check: If target visible at launch, skip racing line entirely
  - Continuous monitoring: Returns to racing line if line of sight is lost
  - Prevents wall collisions on parallel track sections
- **No Distance Limit**: Rockets follow racing line for their entire 3.5-second lifetime
  - Similar to Mario Kart red shells behavior
- **Smooth Navigation**: Rockets navigate around corners using racing line segments
- **Clean Visual**: No additional indicators, just the rocket sprite and effects
- **Same Damage/Explosion**: All existing rocket mechanics remain unchanged
- **Fallback Behavior**: Works normally on maps without racing lines
